- [[second-order thinking]]
	- some events and proposals involve more than a single step when it comes to outcomes

- [[remote-work]]
	- first-step changes from remote work
		- employees save on things like travel expenses, time, fuel, and stress
		- employees have a change in **distractions** (for better or worse)
		- employees have fewer casual **interactions** (for better or worse)
	- second-step changes from remote work
		- employees now may have to compete with potential hires **anywhere** or **remotely**
			- increased competition in local areas once unperturbed due to previous requirements of being in the same location as employer
		- employees now may have to build support networks among new coworkers, friends and/or families, but can this purely be done online?

- [[mobility services]]
	- ride sharing may have been sold to municipalities as ways to decrease traffic, when instead **they may have increased traffic instead**
	- scaled-up ride sharing depresses the market for taxi medallions
	- personal mobility stressed the low-cost, environmentally friendly transport, to help reduce traffic and number of cars on the road
		- **instead** since this service had to be provided to disparate organizations of consumers around a city, high demand areas required a large inventory, in some places bikes and scooters blocked sidewalks and roads

- [[universal basic income]] (ubi)
	- a top-down policy to put 100% of a country on UBI is risky and irreversible
	- _Once you start that top-down experiment, can you stop it if it doesnâ€™t serve the purpose?_

- [[universal healthcare]]
	- healthcare tied to employment does not work
		- most American's health insurance is tied to their employment status, **but is no longer resilient** amidst a pandemic
	- for those with medical conditions or who are part of a vulnerable populace, universal healthcare would alleviate stress or the financial burdens that occurs, whether or not you have insurance
	- healthier individuals are more productive in society

- [[universal education]]
	- higher education should not be a privilege
	- _Poverty must not be a bar to learning and learning must offer an escape from poverty._ - Lyndon B. Johnson
	- society and business would benefit from a larger pool of young, educated workforce
	- allows individuals to take risks and attempt to build things, businesses, products, experiments, etc
	- competition in fields with a younger, broadly educated workforce also drives wages/salaries up

- blockers of [[second-order thinking]]
	- **usually not in anyone's personal interest**
		- dangerous if people start "wedding" themselves to a concept
	- **fast growth**
		- rapid change if difficult to adapt to, to rethink or strategize
	- **avoid linear thinking**
		- avoid reducing our own ability to think of other possible outcomes, 
			- acknowledge the difficulty around "out-of-the-box" thinking or futuristic-ly is evident
	- [[logic and rhetoric#balance fallacy]]
		- in the United States, meeting our 'basic needs' usually falls in between two extremes, the Republican and Democratic party
