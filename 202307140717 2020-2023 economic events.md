Summarizing the last 3 years:

1. COVID hits, initial panic and buckling down
2. WFH and decline in service spending trigger K-shaped consumer surplus
3. Governments overstimulate
4. Goods-based retail therapy to quell pandemic anxiety
5. People lock in low fixed rate mortgages
6. Flush with disposable income, and shifting out of cities, new home and durable purchases skyrocket
7. Governments overstimulate more, inflation starts to launch
8. Economies re-open and revenge travel kicks off
9. More consumer durable purchases: Airbnb and autos (prices keep going up)
10. Stimulus-induced meme stocks and crypto
11. Governments overstimulate more: inflation, inflation, inflation
12. Fed begins major hiking cycle from low levels
13. Everybody panics about recession, which doesn't happen
14. War in Ukraine, people bull up on oil
15. Workforce takes time to re-engage, structural disability and childcare issues are real
16. Governments try to find ways to keep overstimulating (loan forgiveness, etc.) - blames inflation on Ukraine
17. Government taps and keeps tapping SPR
18. Public markets drop: particularly terrible performance in 60/40 portfolios, unprofitable tech and meme stock holders
19. Tech engages major layoffs
20. Private firms refuse to mark down assets (PE and CRE) and even brag about their resilience
21. Fed keeps hiking, economy keeps growing
22. Everybody bulls up on China re-opening, Chinese stocks underperform
22. 0TDE options and JPM collars begin driving artificial price action
23. Major AI breakthroughs happen
24. People realize: expenses have been cut, new technology catalysts exist and revenues have stayed high: US stocks outperform
25. Bank runs kick off with panic around HTM assets
26. People begin thinking China is Japan
27. Fiscal dominance stories become better accepted

In almost all cases above, the experts have been wrong. But they've continued to think they're right.

A lot of the previous catalysts are shifting:

1. Return to Office vs Work from Home, this is significant
2. Cost of Services normalizing vs Cost of Goods
3. Airbnb properties and "buy and hold" autos have different profitability profile
4. Bank lending slowed markedly post runs - Fed policy will begin to have impacts
5. Regulatory position on crypto now clear

... against this:

1. There is still a lot of cash in the system
2. Most studies show equity sentiment is negative in the face of a rally
3. Valuations are overstretched near-term but against a majorly positive catalyst (AI)
4. Stats favor additional bullish price action
5. Two key cycles are on the horizon: elections and Bitcoin halving

Don't pay too much attention to headlines. Dig deep and question the status quo.
