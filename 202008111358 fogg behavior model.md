- a simple model
	- B. J. Fogg, a Stanford professor helps us understand why we _take_ or _don't take_ actions
	- he asserted that the formula (above) represented this shift between decision and indecision
	- **the key** is to require all three components in order to act

- procrastination and motivation
	- how can we build motivation in order to act?
		- finding **meaningful**, **valuable** outcomes to taking action
	- how can we build motivation when you don't see the meaning or value?
		- **remind yourself of the why.**
		- adding personal or meaningful reasons to a task(s)
		- breaking things down into "doable" pieces

	- finding [[intrinsic motivation]]
		- behavior driven by satisfying internal rewards
			- akin to finding and satisfying our passions and goals
		- this idea was researched by [[flow model#Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]
