- Here you can write disorganized notes to be categorized later
- Bullet points are useful, but it could be free form text as well
- Sometimes it's better to just get things off your mind quickly, rather than stop to think where it belongs
- But don't let this list get too long
- Move information to more specific documents and link to them.
  - This helps you navigate between documents quickly
  - For example, you can `Cmd`+`Click` this: [[todo]]
- Some notes don't end up making sense the next day
- That's ok, you can just delete them!
  - You can always find them in your git history, if you really need it!

The Shroud 

Content-Aware Steganography hides information in the semantics a human user assigns to a datagram. These systems offer security against a nonhuman adversary/warden.

There are a variety of basic tests that can be done to identify whether or not a secret message exists. This process is not concerned with the extraction of the message, which is a different process and a separate step. The most basic approaches of steganalysis are visual or aural attacks, structural attacks, and statistical attacks. These approaches attempt to detect the steganographic algorithms that were used.[47] These algorithms range from unsophisticated to very sophisticated, with early algorithms being much easier to detect due to statistical anomalies that were present. The size of the message that is being hidden is a factor in how difficult it is to detect. The overall size of the cover object also plays a factor as well. If the cover object is small and the message is large, this can distort the statistics and make it easier to detect. A larger cover object with a small message decreases the statistics and gives it a better chance of going unnoticed. 

A mimic function changes a file A {\displaystyle A} A so it assumes the statistical properties of another file B {\displaystyle B} B. That is, if p ( t , A ) {\displaystyle p(t,A)} p(t,A) is the probability of some substring t {\displaystyle t} t occurring in A {\displaystyle A} A, then a mimic function f {\displaystyle f} f, recodes A {\displaystyle A} A so that p ( t , f ( A ) ) {\displaystyle p(t,f(A))} p(t,f(A)) approximates p ( t , B ) {\displaystyle p(t,B)} p(t,B) for all strings t {\displaystyle t} t of length less than some n {\displaystyle n} n. It is commonly considered to be one of the basic techniques for hiding information, often called steganography. 

Even more sophisticated models use reversible Turing machines.
